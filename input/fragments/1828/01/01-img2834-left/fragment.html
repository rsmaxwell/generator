<p>... as every man must do, who keeps there grand maxim in view &quot;Do onto others as you would they should do unto you&quot;, he who attends to this well , never get far wrong &amp; thank god so far I feel I can apply the quotation &quot;mens conscia recti&quot; to myself indeed . I am made to feel it by the kind &amp; friendly manner in which every person receive me I hope I deserve it, I do not know that I ever did an injury to anyone certain never intentionally.</p>
<p>However there is one person whose conduct has indeed been that of a friend &amp; such a friend as seldom is met with &amp; I cannot omit recording it here &amp; were I ever to forget it should indeed be ungrateful &amp; unworthy of every kind feeling. John Tinley is the man who could feel for the misfortunes of another. He it was who paved the way for our emancipation from all difficulties. Where is the friend that would have acted as he did? I fear not to be found. He came forward not a friend in words but in deeds. He made not promises, nor exacted hopes &amp; expectations, to disappoint &amp; blast them when called upon. He saw our situation, he volunteered his services as security, without which we could have effected nothing &amp; thus has the primary cause of our accomplishing all that has been done. He thought he knew us &amp; I hope has not been deceived. This is what I call friendship, true &amp; sincere, not according to the worldly acceptation &amp; profanation of the word, but friendship in the true spirit &amp; meaning of the word.</p>
<p>I yesterday, the last day of the old year, dined with this my excellent friend &amp; accompanied him Miss Barton A party to the ball &amp; spent a very pleasant evening &amp; thus ended the old &amp; began the new year merrily. I hope it is a good omen. Today I again dined with J Tinley to meet Mr Waldie to a very agreeable party.</p>
